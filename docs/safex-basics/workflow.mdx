# Workflow

This section elaborates the Safex workflow and list out the glossary.

## Who are involved in the protocol?

Safex mainly consists of these below actors for functioning of the protocol.

- üßë‚Äçüîß   **Safe creator**
- üôçüôç   **Safe inheritor/ safe claimer (Beneficiary)**
- üíÇüíÇ   **Safe guardians**
- üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è   **Claim arbitrators (Auto appointed)**
- üôçüôç   **Safe Executor (Often beneficiary)**

As shown in the below diagram, each one of them interacts with the safe at one or the other phase of Safex flow. Refer to the workflow section for the entire Safex flow.

### Core actors of Safex protocol:

**Safe creator:**
Anyone who has an account on [Safex](https://app.getsafex.co) can create a safe by adding the beneficiary and safe data (seed phrases or any other secret note). The safe creator may decide to pay a safe maintenance fee during the safe creation or at any time later.

 **Safe inheritor/ safe claimer (Beneficiary):**
Safe beneficiaries are the ones who can claim the created safes. The safe creator themselves can be the beneficiary (for safe backup) or it can be their loved ones (for safe inheritance). It is a requirement that safe beneficiaries should be part of Safex (should have registered).

 **Safe guardians**
Safe guardians are responsible for guarding and recovering the safes. No single guardian or set of guardians can recover the safe data entirely. But they are majorly responsible to recover the safe data. They make sure that the beneficiary can claim the safe data only after the "*safe claim*" has been verified.
Safe guardians are trustless in nature. That means neither the safe creator nor the beneficiary needs to trust these guardians. These guardians are appointed at random based on their protocol credentials.
The guardians are will be eligible for incentivization (deducted from the safe maintenance fee) whenever they participate in the safe recovery process.

### Secondary/ optional actors:

 **Claim arbitrators:**
Currently, claim arbitrators are not the direct participants of the Safex protocol but they help to verify the safe claims created. Safex will use [Kleros](https://kleros.io/integrations) for creating and resolving safe claims.

 **Safe executor:**
Safex doesn't explicitly require an executor to claim the safe. Instead, beneficiaries themselves act as safe executors.

### Entire application flow:

The technical workflow of Safex may seem slighlty elongated, but we are making sure that this doesn't hamper the user experience any participant. Here is how the application flow and a life cycle of a **safe** on Safex will look like:

- **User registers on the [Safex](http://app.getsafex.co/) platform.**
- **User creates a Safe**
    - Adds beneficiary
    - Selects the type of claim (auto/ manual)

        Refer glossary section to know more about the type of claim

    - Selects the type of data to secure/ share (Seed phrases/ Generic secret note)
    - Adds the data
    - Publishes the safe
- **Beneficiary creates a safe claim request**
    - Creates a claim with evidences (In case of manual claim)
    - Arbitrators validates the safe (In case of manual claim)
    - Trustless guardians recover the safe data

        Refer core actors section to know more about the guardians

## Technical workflow

Safex protocol is an amalgamation of a few of the fascinating web3 technology tools and protocols such as [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/), [Textile](https://textile.io/) tools, [Ceramic](http://ceramic.network) network, and Ethereum blockchain. The combination of off-chain and onchain infrastructure is what makes the Safex technical architecture quite elegant.

*Each web3 technology tool or protocol used in Safex has a unique role to play.*

**Textile ThreadDb**: Stores public information of each user and and metadata of each safe created.

**IPFS**: Safex makes use of Textile buckets to store the safes of each user and thus leverages the IPFS technology to decentralize the safe storage. Although the safes are publicly accessible, they are protected with encryption algorithms and cryptography mechanisms such as [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing).

**Ceramic Network/ IDX**: Safex leverages Ceramic network as an identity layer by storing user information. and links the safe information to make it immutable. Safex will generate an unique identity (DID) and mainatain them on the Ceramic network to easily interact with each user on the network.

**Filecoin**: Safex ensures the safe durability by making sure that the IPFS data is always available with the help of Filecoin network. We use Textile [powergate](https://docs.textile.io/powergate/) to access the filecoin network and create deals.

**Ethereum contracts**: Safex has an incentivization and claim layer that ensures that the protocol is self reliant by incentivizing all the actors such as guardians. Currently, [Kleros](https://kleros.io/integrations) dispute resolution is used to manage the claims created by the safe beneficiaries.

The following section depicts the step by step technical workflow for **safe creation** and **safe claim**.

### Safe creation:

1. User creates a safe by encrypting the safe data with a randomly generated symmetric key (Safe secret). The encrypted safe data is then broadcasted to the IPFS network and then replicated with the help of Filecoin network. 
2. Once the user selects the beneficiary, the safe secret is encrypted for the beneficiary but it is never stored anywhere. The encrypted safe secret is then split into shards with the help of *Shamir's secret sharing* mechanism. Each of these shards are then allocated to a randomly selected trusltess guarding by encrypting it to them. All these encrypted shards are distributed to the guardians and also stored on the decentralized database (ThreadDb).
3. When the safe creation is initiated, the user may also pay the safe maintanance fee to the Safex incentivization contract on the Ethereim network. The fee can also be paid anytime before the safe is claimed.

### Safe claim:

1. The beneficiary for whom the safe is assigned may claim the safe at anytime. Once the safe claim is initiated, a claim is created on the Kleros arbitration platform with type of claim, description and evidence.
2. When the claim is accepted by the arbitrators on the Kleros platform, it will allow the guardians to recover the safe.
3. A minimum set of guardians required for the safe recovery will decrypt their shard and submit to the safe.
4. The safe beneficiary will claim and decrypt the the safe once the guardians have recovered the required number of shards.
